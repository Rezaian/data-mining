# Decision Tree Weather Prediction

This project demonstrates the use of a Decision Tree classifier to predict weather conditions (e.g., drizzle, rain, sun, snow, fog) based on meteorological variables such as precipitation, temperature, and wind speed. The dataset is preprocessed to encode categorical variables, and split into training and testing sets (80/20 split). The Decision Tree model is visualized and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. For better interpretability, the tree is rendered as a high-quality PDF, which you can view by clicking the link below:

Key libraries used include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and graphviz. This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to decision tree modeling in Python.
